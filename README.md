## Welcome to Windows COM Objects DataBase

This is a simple website that contains a database of COM Objects from different windows builds. 
This database was generated using James Forshaw's oledotnetview tool which I encourage to to check out and use for messing around with COM. 

If you have any requests or suggesstions for additions to this DB or additional features for convience of search, open an issue in the repo.
